# Project Experiment Results and Data Documentation

This directory is dedicated to housing both the results and scripts associated with the experiments carried out for our project. Below, you'll find detailed information on what's included and how to navigate these resources.

## Contents

### 1. Scripts

Included in this directory are several scripts crucial for the experiment's execution and analysis:

- **Batch Execution Scripts for *Diamond Energy* Algorithm:** These are scripts designed to run the test molecules through the Diamond Energy algorithm. Following the primary process, a MacroModel minimization process is applied as post-processing to refine the results.
  
- **Comparison Algorithms Execution Scripts:** For comparative analysis, we have included scripts to run four well-established algorithms in MacroModel via command line mode in batch. This allows for a comprehensive comparison between our approach and existing methods.
  
- **Results Analysis Scripts:** To assist in the understanding and evaluation of the experimental outcomes, scripts for reading and analyzing the results from these calculations are also provided.

### 2. Raw Data

All the raw data generated from the first step of the experiments are accessible for review and further analysis. To facilitate sharing, the data has been uploaded to a Google Drive folder:

### 3. Results Summary

The outcomes of the experiments, including detailed summary, are compiled into CSV files for easy access and review.
