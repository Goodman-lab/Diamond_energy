This directory contains the raw data(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RR0EAIp40pAYexjrT67qrCJOsWd0G0Id/view?usp=drive_link) and summary results in .csv files from running the *Diamond Energy* algorithm alone for diamond lattice alignment and low-energy conformer generation without further minimization.

More raw data of this project, indlucing the comparison expriments between *Diamond Energy* algorithm with minization in MacroModel and four well established algorithms: SPMC, LMCS, MCMM, MCLMCS, could be found in this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14vlid0XVxIC8Sn-zO5UIbjOkiB9QCQFv?usp=drive_link.
